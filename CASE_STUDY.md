# Case Study Scenarios to discuss

## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
**Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.

**Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment is challenging because expenses like labor, transportation, inventory handling, and overhead are often shared across multiple warehouses and stores. These costs don’t neatly map to a single product or location, and the dynamic nature of inventory flows makes it difficult to trace the true cost of each movement. Overhead expenses such as utilities or IT systems add another layer of complexity, since they must be distributed fairly without distorting the picture of operational efficiency. Striking the right balance between granularity and practicality is essential—too much detail overwhelms systems, while too little detail leads to misleading allocations.

Important considerations include identifying the right cost drivers (e.g., number of picks, distance traveled, or cubic volume handled), ensuring transparency in allocation rules, and integrating operational and financial data across systems. Questions that naturally arise are: how should transportation costs be allocated—by distance, weight, or revenue contribution? Should overhead be distributed based on square footage, throughput, or headcount? And how do we ensure fairness when one store consistently requires more urgent shipments than others? These considerations highlight that cost allocation is not just an accounting exercise but a strategic tool for decision‑making, influencing choices about warehouse expansion, store replenishment policies, and overall supply chain design.

## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
**Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.

**Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Cost optimization in fulfillment operations requires balancing efficiency with service quality. The main strategies often revolve around labor management, inventory optimization, transportation efficiency, and overhead reduction. For labor, companies can introduce better workforce scheduling, automation in repetitive tasks, and cross‑training staff to reduce idle time. Inventory optimization involves using demand forecasting and just‑in‑time replenishment to minimize holding costs while avoiding stockouts. Transportation costs can be reduced through route optimization, load consolidation, and negotiating carrier contracts. Overhead expenses such as energy and facility costs can be lowered by adopting energy‑efficient equipment, space utilization improvements, and shared services across warehouses.

To identify and prioritize strategies, companies should start with a cost breakdown analysis to see which categories (labor, inventory, transport, overhead) contribute most to total expenses. High‑impact areas become the first focus. Prioritization should also consider feasibility—quick wins like renegotiating transport contracts can be implemented faster than long‑term automation projects. Implementation requires cross‑functional collaboration between finance, operations, and IT, supported by clear KPIs such as cost per order, warehouse throughput, and delivery lead times. The expected outcomes include reduced operating costs, improved resource utilization, and sustained service quality, ultimately strengthening competitiveness and scalability of the fulfillment network.

## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
**Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Integrating a Cost Control Tool with existing financial systems is critical because it ensures that expense data is consistent, accurate, and available in real time. Without integration, cost tracking often relies on manual reconciliation, which introduces delays and errors. Real‑time synchronization allows managers to see the true cost picture across warehouses and stores, making it easier to identify inefficiencies and act quickly. It also supports compliance and audit requirements, since financial records and operational data remain aligned.

The benefits of integration include streamlined reporting, faster decision‑making, and improved transparency. Finance teams gain confidence that operational costs (labor, inventory, transportation, overhead) are reflected correctly in the general ledger, while operations teams can monitor KPIs like cost per order or warehouse throughput without waiting for end‑of‑month reports. To ensure seamless integration, you’d focus on standardized data models, APIs for real‑time exchange, and robust validation rules to prevent mismatches. Prioritizing security and access control is equally important, since financial data is sensitive. With these measures, the company can achieve both operational efficiency and financial accuracy, enabling proactive cost management rather than reactive corrections.

## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
**Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations are essential because they provide visibility into future costs and resource needs, allowing the company to plan proactively rather than reactively. Without structured forecasting, expenses such as labor, transportation, and inventory holding can fluctuate unpredictably, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities. Accurate budgeting ensures that resources are allocated to the right warehouses and stores, balancing cost control with service quality. Forecasting also helps anticipate seasonal demand spikes, supply chain disruptions, or changes in customer behavior, enabling the company to prepare financially and operationally.

Designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting requires careful consideration of several factors. Historical data on costs and demand patterns must be integrated with real‑time operational metrics to improve predictive accuracy. The system should account for cost drivers such as order volume, distance traveled, and labor hours, while also incorporating external variables like fuel prices or supplier lead times. Flexibility is key: the tool must allow scenario planning (e.g., “what if demand increases by 20%?”) and sensitivity analysis to test assumptions. Finally, seamless integration with financial systems ensures that forecasts align with actuals, enabling continuous refinement and building trust in the numbers. Together, these capabilities empower the company to allocate resources effectively, reduce risk, and maintain competitiveness in a dynamic fulfillment environment.

## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
**Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.

**Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Replacing an existing warehouse with a new one while reusing the same business unit code introduces important cost control considerations. Preserving the cost history of the old warehouse is essential because it provides a baseline for evaluating performance, identifying trends, and understanding the true cost drivers of fulfillment operations. Without historical data, it becomes difficult to compare whether the new warehouse is operating more efficiently or whether costs are escalating in hidden areas such as labor or transportation. Cost history also supports financial transparency and compliance, ensuring that past expenses remain traceable for audits and long‑term planning.

Maintaining this continuity directly relates to keeping the new warehouse within budget. Historical cost data allows managers to forecast expected expenses, set realistic budgets, and monitor deviations in real time. For example, if labor costs in the old warehouse consistently accounted for 40% of total expenses, the new warehouse can use that benchmark to evaluate whether staffing levels are aligned or drifting. Similarly, transportation and overhead costs can be tracked against historical averages to ensure that the new facility does not introduce inefficiencies. By preserving cost history and integrating it into budgeting and monitoring processes, the company can control spending, identify early warning signs of overruns, and ensure that the new warehouse delivers both operational and financial improvements.
